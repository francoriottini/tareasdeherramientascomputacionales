- Java, C++ and Python are all object-oriented programming languages.
- We can run Pytjon from the command prompt using "python".
- We can use "pass" in any place in Python code to tell interpreter “to do nothing” and move to next instruction.
- Python 3 is a newer version, but it is not backward compatible with Python 2.
- To run python script file named test.py, use the command python test.py (from the command prompt).
- PyChecker and Pylint are tools that help us find bugs.
- In Python, 'Hello', is the same as "Hello"-
- Python was created by Guido van Rossum.
- It's possible to check for more than one error in one except line if the exception types are enclosed in parentheses.
- keywords can't be variables
- __init__ can be a variable
- Variable names have unlimited length 
- open is not a keyword (but lambda is)
- 1var can't be a variable
- A variable shouldn't be declared before it is assigned a value
- 79 is the maximum possible length of an identifier or an attribute !!
- id() returns the unique number assigned to an object.
- From the execution of the statements  n = 300,  m = n we create one object and two references. I thought it was two objects and two references, it was tricky
- with j and J we define complex numbers
- inf is float
- 0.2 + 0.3 == 0.5 is True, I thought it was False
- ~5 = 6?
- tuples can be used for keys in dictionaries
- trunc() returns an int
- Boolean type is a subtype of Integer data type in Python
- An interesting list of resources from the Strings one:
	• .format()
	• .expandtabs()
	• .split()
	• format("","")
	• .swapcase()
	• .partition('')
	• .isidentifier()
	• .center() ---------} didn't understand this
	• .find("")
	• .splitlines()
	• .islower()
	• .maketrans("", "") 
	• .replace
	• .title
	• .count("", , )
- From Sets: .isdisjoint(); .diference_update(); a1|a2 = a1.union(a2); 
- From List: zip(), deepcopy() ?;
- From Tuples: from collections .namedtuple; 
- From Files:  
	To read the entire remaining contents of the file as a string from a file object f, we use .read
	To open a file c:\text.txt for writing, we use outfile = open(“c:\\test.txt”, “w”)
	os.rename(old_file, new_name) to rename a file
	os.remove(‘file’) to remove a file
	The readlines() method returns a list of lines
