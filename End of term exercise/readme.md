End of term excercise of "computational tools for scientific research" in UdeSA
------------------------
We replicate some maps and complement the work of Nathan Nunn and Leonard Wantchekon in the paper "The Slave Trade and the Origins of Mistrust in Africa" of 2011. We also used data from Nunn (2010) and Nunn and Diego Puga (2012).

We thank the authors for the well-ordered files, mainly, for our interest in this work, the shapefiles.

Finally, we also thank Ki-Data [https://data.kimetrica.com/] for health facilities in Sub-saharian Africa.
